mtcmd : Magnetic tape device controller for MacOS X

Usage
mtcmd [option...] [cmd]

-----------------------------------------------------------------

1.	option
	-i	Display the device number of all the tape devices connected 
		to the SCSI ports.
		Please specify one of this number to the parameter of '-t' option.
		* Important :
			o Whenever executing any command, the device number must be specified with '-t' option.
			o The device number displayed by this option has no relations to the SCSI ID.

	-I	Display the inquiry data, block limits data, and mode parameter 
		page data of the target device.
		The information on all devices are displayed by default.
		When a device number is specified by -t option, it outputs specified device information only. 
		* Note : 
			The information on data compression page is 
			displayed only when the device supports it.

	-t n	Set target device for 'cmd' to 'n'.
		'n' is a number displayed by '-i'.
		* Important : 
			This option can not be omitted when specifying any command.
	
	-bs n	Set both input and output block size to 'n' bytes.
		By default, block size is set to 512 bytes.
		This option is ignored when the target device supports fixed block size only.
		* Note : 
			-	If the target device only supports block sizes larger 
				than 512 bytes, an error will occur when read or write 
				command is executed.
				In such case, please specify larger block size expressly.
			-	When the data to read and write is less than the block 
				size, it will padded by 0.
		* Important : 
			The detail behavior is explained in "6-3 : 
			About '-bs' options behavior".
	
	-bf n	Set block count to read and write to n.
		By default, block count is set to 20 blocks.
		* Note : 
			When the data to read and write is less than the block count, it will padded by 0

	-if f	Set input file to 'f'.
		Reads the specified file 'f' to input instead of the standard input.
		This option is effective only when 'write' command is specified.
		By default, input is the standard input.

	-of f	Set output file to 'f'.
		Writes output data to the specified file 'f'.
		This option is effective only when 'read command is specified.
		By default, output is the standard output.

	-c m	Set the compression mode for writing.
		'y' or 'n' can be specified to 'm'.
			y : set the compression mode to enable.
			n : set the compression mode to disable.
		By default, it operates in the mode preset to the device.
		* Note : 
			This option is effective when only the device supports 
			data compression.

	-dt t	Set writing density type to EXB-8505 tape drive.
		'l', 'm', 'h', or 'c' can be specified to 't'.
			l : 8200 format(up to 2GB by 112M tape un-compressing)
			m : 8500 format(up to 5GB by 112M tape un-compressing)
			h : 8500c format(up to 10GB by 112M tape with 
			    compression)
			c : Same as h.
		By the default, it operates in the mode preset to the device.
		* Important : 
			This option is effective only for the EXB-8505 
			tape drive.
			The EXB-8505 allows to change compression mode by 
			'-c' only when density type is set to 8500c format.

	-h	Display simple help message.
	
	-v	Display version number.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

2.	cmd

	Any one of the following command can be specified.
	Any command operates the device which is specified by '-t' option.
	* Important : 
		It can not omit '-t' whenever any of 'cmd' is specified.
	
	read	Read data from the tape specified by '-t'.

	write	Write data to the tape specified by '-t'.
	
	fsf n	Forward to n-th end-of-file mark.
	
	bsf n	Rewind to n-th end-of-file mark.
	
	weof n	Write n end-of-file mark at current position of the head.
	
	smk n	Write n end-of-set mark at current position of the head.
			(currently not implemented)
	
	rewind	Rewind the tape to beginning of the tape.
	
	offline	Place the device off-line state. 
			In most case, ejects the tape cartridge.

	rewoffl	Rewind the tape to beginning of the tape and place the 
			device off-line state. 
	
	erase	Erase the tape.
	
	setopt	Perform the following setup to the device.
				o Block size specified by '-bs'.
				o Compression mode specified by '-c'.
			This command only sets transmission conditions to the 
			device, and does not actually run the tape.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

3.	Examples

	3-1	Check device number :

		$ mtcmd -i
		target 1 : EXABYTE EXB-8505SMBANSH20793
		target 2 : ARCHIVE VIPER 150  21531-004


	3-2	Read from device number 1 and expand the data with tar :
	
		$ mtcmd -t 1 read | tar xvf -
		dir
		dir/file
		    :
		    :


	3-3	Write ./somearchive.tar.gz to device number 1 :

		$ mtcmd -t 1 -if ./somearchive.tar.gz write


	3-4	Eject tape cartridge from device Number 1 :

		$ mtcmd -t 1 offline


	3-5	archive somedir by tar, compress by gzip, and write it to device
		number 2 :

		$ tar cvf - somedir | gzip | mtcmd -t 2 write
		dir
		dir/file
		    :
		    :

-----------------------------------------------------------------

4.	Notes

4-1	'Block Length == 0' error :

	A:	When a media is not inserted
		There are some device which fails in execution SCSI command 
		'ReadBlockLimits' when no media is inserted in the device.
		For these device, an error message is displayed when '-i' or '-I' 
		has been specified.
		In such a case, when a media is inserted to the device, it will 
		be come to operate normally.

	b:	When a media is inserted

		There are some device which fails in execution SCSI command 
		'ReadBlockLimits' in spite of that a media is inserted the device.
		In this case, an error message is displayed same as case 'a'.
		If a command is again executed with the same parameter, when you 
		will operate normally, the above-mentioned error should be 
		disregarded.


4-2	'-bs' options behavior

	The transfer block size will be changed whether '-bs' is specified 
	or not.
	The details are as follows.

	4-2-1	When '-bs' is not specified
		a:	If the device supports fixed block size only :
			->	it reads/writes with the block size supported by the 
				device.
		b:	If the device supports variable block size :
			->	it reads/writes with variable block size mode.

	4-2-2 : When '-bs' is specified
		a:	If 0 is specified :
	    	Work with variable block size mode
			a-1	If the device supports fixed block size only :
				->	It reads/writes with the block size supported by the 
					device.
			a-2	If the device supports variable block size :
				->	It reads/writes by variable block size.
		b:	If other than 0 is specified.
	    	Work with specified block size
			b-1	If the device supports fixed block size only :
				->	It reads/writes with the block size supported by the 
					device.
			b-2	If the device supports variable block size :
				->	It reads/writes with specified block size.


4-3	Reading / Writing Operation and Early Warning
	Reading / writing operation is continued until the device returns 
	"Check Condition" status.
	For this reason, if the device returns "Early Warning", reading / 
	writing operation is terminated at that time.


4-4	Multiple Tape Volume Is Not Supported
	mtcmd supports only one tape volume.


4-5	Operation Which Changes Mode Select Parameter
	mtcmd may rewrite Mode Select Parameter of a device. However, it does
	not write it to non-volatility memory area.
	So, the parameter will be recovered when the device got a reset signal
	or power cycle(down and up).

-----------------------------------------------------------------

5.	Compile from Source
	If you have installed 'Developer Tools' with XCode, you can compile
	this by just 'make' only.
	Although mtcmd operates using SCSI Task User Client, SCSI Task User 
	Client SDK which has come out from Apple is not required.

	In the very old MacOS X, you may need to include IOSCSILib.h.
	In such case, please add following line at the begging of the *.c
	files.
	#include <IOKit/cdb/IOSCSILib.h>
